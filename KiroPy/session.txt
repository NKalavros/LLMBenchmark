New Session





Write a program in Python which downloads the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset GSE149440 and uses expression data of tens of thousands of genes in a few hundred samples to fit a prediction model of gestational age (gestational age:ch1) variable from the metadata. Only samples assigned to the training set (metadata variable train:ch1=='1') should be used for training. You are free to use a validation set to optimize your model. Apply the model on the test defined as metadata variable train:ch1==0. Print the root mean squared error (RMSE) on the test set and generate a scatter plot of the predicted vs actual gestational age values for the test set. Try to optimize your RMSE as much as you can. Packages you might need are already present, or you can install them. Just run code until the task is compete.

I'll help you create a Python program to download the GSE149440 dataset and build a prediction model for gestational age. Let me start by creating the script.

Good, GEOparse is installed. Let me run the script again and see if it's working:

Command

Try to optimize your RMSE

Kiro
I'll optimize the RMSE by implementing several advanced techniques. Let me create an improved version of the analysis script with better feature selection, ensemble methods, and hyperparameter optimization.
