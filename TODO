Gustavo - Agentic - Integrate Biomni and Robin in our agentic testing
Gustavo - Agentic - Use NYU Claude key to ensure we can do our quick headless comparison - I guess we can but huge timeout issues


1. Code semantics analysis for agents

  - Obtain OpenAI embeddings and OpenAI summarization for the code (DSPy)


2. Make it runnable through the CLI

  - Roo code for Docker - Easy implem
  - CLIne CLI - Easy implem
  - Claude Code - It's basically already there
  - OpenHands CLI - Easy implem
  - RovoDev - It's basically already there
  - KiroDev - You can run it from the CLI too, but needs testing
  - Cursor CLI - Just rolled out
  - VSCode headless for the BeastModev3 agent - Will need some work.
  - Gemini CLI - Easy implem
  - Qwen CLI - Easy implem


3. Identify 4, 5 challenges to start evaluating

Blood transcriptomics Gestational Age Prediction - This one

Single cell signaling in breast cancer Phosphoproteomics (https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202110402)

Lineage reconstruction (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471221001940)

PANACEA challenge (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8784774/)

PD-L1 prediction (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38383458/)

4. Evaluation framework for this (DeepEval again?) - Done
